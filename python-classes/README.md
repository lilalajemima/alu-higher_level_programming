This is the start of object oriented programming 
Key features of OOP are class, instance/object, attributes and methods 
Class is like a type of things 
Instance/object are the things that fall under a class/belong to a class 
Attributes are what sets apart objects in a class like the identifcations of an object 
Methods are functions that are specifc to a class or a function

Main functions are 
-class
-__init__
-def
